What is the purpose of the -h flag of the ls command in UNIX?
Print file sizes in human readable format
Print short help message
Print long help message
Print hidden files
When used together with the -l flag for long format, the -h makes the ls command print file sizes in human readable format like 1K, 234M, 2G.

Can you parse an HTML document using regular expressions?
No, because HTML is not a regular language
Yes, you can parse anything using regular expressions
Yes, but only if it contains only ASCII characters
Yes, because HTML is a context-free language
Regular expressions can only match regular languages but HTML is a context-free language. It is always possible to present a HTML file that will be matched wrongly by any regular expression.

Which is a good reason to use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList?
I will only access elements by traversing from the beginning
LinkedList is more efficient than ArrayList in most practical cases
LinkedList uses a hashmap internally
I can access any element in a LinkedList very fast
In a linked list, elements are chained together: each element has a pointer to the next. Insert and remove operations are more memory-efficient compared to an ArrayList, at the cost that random access of elements is less efficient.

END
What is the advantage of using an ArrayList instead of a LinkedList?
Accessing elements by index is faster
Traversal of elements from start to end is faster
ArrayList uses less memory than a LinkedList
Removing an element in the middle of the list is faster
Elements in an ArrayList can be accessed directly by a numeric index, but in a LinkedList you must travers the elements from the start or the end until the desired element.

What is the traditional step between "./configure" and "make install" when building a software from a source tarball?
"make"
"make universe"
"make clean"
"./run.sh"
"make" without any arguments runs the default build task, which is typically building the entire software. This step is usually after the configuration step. After this the software can be installed with "make install".

What is the purpose of the "clean" step in a typical automated build system?
Remove generated files
Detect and report bugs in the software
Detect and eliminate bugs in the software
Remove unknown files that don't belong to the project
The "clean" step typically removes build products, with the intention to start over as if the "compile" or other build steps were never executed.

In Linux, what is the best way to give read permission to everybody on a file?
chmod +r file.txt

What can be a disadvantage of a distributed VCS in comparison to a centralized VCS?
The initial cloning is slower
Users cannot commit revisions without a server
Most operations are slower without a server
Users cannot create forks without a server
In a distributed VCS, initial cloning is typically slower, as the tool must download the entire project history. The other choices are disadvantages of centralized VCS.

In a version control system, which type of conflict can have an automatic resolution when merging branchA into branchB?
The same file was edited in both BranchA and BranchB
The same file was edited in BranchA but deleted in BranchB
The same file was edited in BranchA but renamed in BranchB
A file with the same name was added in both BranchA and BranchB
If branchA and branchB edited completely different parts of the file, that should be possible to resolve automatically. The other types of conflict require an explicit decision and action by a human.

What version control operation requires access to the server in a centralized VCS?

What is the most likely cause of a stack overflow?
Too deep recursion when using a recursive function
Trying to access an array element by an index beyond the end of the array
Trying to access an array element by a negative index
The stack size limit is not set to unlimited in your system
A common cause of a stack overflow is very deep or infinite recursion, exhausting the address space of the call stack. A common solution is to improve the algorithm to reduce the depth of recursions.
