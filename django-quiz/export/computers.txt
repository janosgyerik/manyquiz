Which is a good reason to use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList?
I will only access elements by traversing from the beginning
LinkedList is more efficient than ArrayList in most practical cases
LinkedList uses a hashmap internally
I can access any element in a LinkedList very fast
In a linked list, elements are chained together: each element has a pointer to the next. Insert and remove operations are more memory-efficient compared to an ArrayList, at the cost that random access of elements is less efficient.

What is the advantage of using an ArrayList instead of a LinkedList?
Accessing elements by index is faster
Traversal of elements from start to end is faster
ArrayList uses less memory than a LinkedList
Removing an element in the middle of the list is faster

The initial cloning is slower

The same file was edited in BranchA but renamed in BranchB
A file with the same name was added in both BranchA and BranchB

What version control operation requires access to the server in a centralized VCS?

What is the most likely cause of a stack overflow?
Too deep recursion when using a recursive function 
Trying to access an array element by an index beyond the end of the array
Trying to access an array element by a negative index
The stack size limit is not set to unlimited in your system
A common cause of a stack overflow is very deep or infinite recursion, exhausting the address space of the call stack. A common solution is to improve the algorithm to reduce the depth of recursions.
