When would you use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList?
When you only need to traverse elements from the beginning
LinkedList is more efficient than ArrayList in most practical cases
LinkedList uses a hashmap internally
I can access any element in a LinkedList very fast
In a linked list, elements are chained together: each element has a pointer to the next. Insert and remove operations are more memory-efficient compared to an ArrayList, at the cost that random access of elements is less efficient.

What is the advantage of using an ArrayList instead of a LinkedList?
Accessing elements by index is faster
Traversal of elements from start to end is faster
ArrayList uses less memory than a LinkedList

Too deep recursion when using a recursive function

A common cause of a stack overflow is very deep or infinite recursion, exhausting the address space of the call stack. A common solution is to improve the algorithm to reduce the depth of recursions.
