route configuration
IP address configuration
netmask configuration
It is not possible to connect to another computer without configuring a network interface with an IP address and correct netmask, and a route between the computers. A name server is optional.

How to check if port 1234 is listening for incoming connections?
telnet localhost 1234
ping localhost 1234
telnet 1234
netstat -p 1234
telnet is useful to check if a port is open. Another easy way is using netstat, but not with the -p flag.

Which is not necessarily the cause when you cannot ping google.com?
The local PC is on a NAT
The nameserver has crashed
The firewall is blocking all ICMP packets
There is no route from the local PC to google.com
Being on a NAT does not necessarily prevent access to the outside. The other factors would necessarily prevent pinging google.com

How to ensure that newly created files are not accessible by anybody else?
umask 0077
umask 0044

How to find directories that are accessible by other users?
find target/dir -type d -perm +0007 -exec chmod o-rwx {} \;

How to match an empty line using regular expressions?
^$

How to view lines of a file that don't contain the text "DEBUG"?
grep -v DEBUG file.log | less
grep ^DEBUG file.log | less
