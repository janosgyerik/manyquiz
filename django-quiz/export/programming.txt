When would you use a LinkedList instead of an ArrayList?
When you only traverse elements from the beginning
Always, LinkedList is usually more efficient than ArrayList

Which command will produce different output?
ls | perl -e 'm/tmp/ && print;'

^(?:\d{8}|(?=\d+-\d+)[\d\-]{9})$
^(?:\d{8}|(?=\d+-\d+$)[\d\-]{8})$
^(?:\d{8}|[\d\-]{9})$
